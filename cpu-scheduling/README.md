# CA216 CPU Scheduling

## How to Run
In order to run an algorithm you would have to decided on which testfile you want to test with. For this example I will use schedule.txt.

You need to run python followed by the name of the python program followed by the test file.

> python3 pythonfile testfile

If you would want to run the FCFS algorithm, it would be as follows:

    python3 schedule_fcfs.py schedule.txt
